/// data for all the locales are directly imported by the program. Once lazy
/// loading is available, we expect this to be the preferred mode, with
/// the initialization code actually loading the specific libraries needed.

/// This defines messages for an English locale directly in the program and
/// has separate libraries that define German and Thai messages that say more or
/// less the same thing, and prints the message with the date and time in it
/// formatted appropriately for the locale.
