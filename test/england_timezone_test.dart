/// Test date formatting and parsing while the system time zone is set to

///
/// This is the same as UTC for part of the year, which makes it an interesting
/// edge case.

// This test relies on setting the TZ environment variable to affect the
// system's time zone calculations. That's only effective on Linux environments,
// and would only work in a browser if we were able to set it before the browser
// launched, which we aren't. So restrict this test to the VM and Linux.
