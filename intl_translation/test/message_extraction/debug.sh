# The message_extraction_test.dart test uses a temporary directory and spawns
# separate processes for each step. This can make it very painful to debug the
# steps.
# This script runs the steps individually, putting the files in the current
# directory. You can run the script to run the test locally, or use this to
# run individual steps or create them as launches in the editor.
